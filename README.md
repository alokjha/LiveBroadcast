# LiveBroadcast
MX Player Hackathon 2019

Giving a backdrop for this feature: We want to build MX Player as the go to destination among artists and social media influencers. MX Player would become the standout platform away from the clutter of existing platforms. An artist's MX Player profile should be a one stop shop to showcase his/her portfolio.

"LiveBroadcast" is one of the many features which we will be building as tools and values for artists and other users to maintain and promote thei MX Player profile. A simple gist of this feature is:

 - Artist should be able to notify his/her subscribers about an upcoming live broadcast that he/she will be conducting. This broadcast can be a small teaser of an upcoming video, or a live coverage of an event or a cause, and other such things.
 
 - At the start of the live broadcast, subscribers will again get a notification that broadcast is about to start and they will start watching the live broadcast.
 
 - During the broadcast, if the artist uploaded a poll to gather subscribers' reviews, all the subscribers will be able to participate in that poll.
 
 - At the end of the broadcast, the live content will become a video and get added to artist's channel. These videos can be a nudge for other users to become subscribers for the artist and never miss any future broadcast live.
